                <ol>
                    <li><p>Put the oil with the chopped onion and carrot in a large frying pan and <strong>fry over medium heat for 10 minutes</strong>, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
    
                    <li><p>After that time we add the tomato and fry for five more minutes. Add the minced meat, increase the heat to medium-high and cook everything for 10 minutes, stirring so that <strong>the meat does not become caked</strong>.</p></li>
                
                    <li><p>Add the beans and jalapenos and cook for five more minutes. Season with salt and pepper and <strong>set aside off the heat</strong> in a bowl.</p></li>
                
                    <li><p>We arrange a wheat tortilla on a board, fill it with two heaping tablespoons of filling, <strong>put the cheese on top to melt</strong> and close it like a burrito, tightly. So with all chimichangas.</p></li>
                
                    <li><p>In hot oil, at <strong>about 160-175 ºC, we fry</strong> the pieces that we have prepared. To secure the filling we can close them with some toothpicks so that they do not open when we put them in to fry.</p></li>

                    <li><p>We serve the chimichangas on a plate and put <strong>two tablespoons of sour cream</strong> and a little of the chopped raw vegetable mixture on top. We finish the plating with some cilantro leaves and grating the peel of a lime on top.</p></li>
