    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The potatoes</h3>
    <ol> <p>
        To prepare the fries, peel the potatoes and cut them into slices approximately 1 cm thick. Cut each <strong>slice into sticks 1 cm wide and about 5 cm long</strong> and we continue with all the slices until we have the potatoes ready for the next phase.
    </p>
    <h4>Soaking</h4>
    <li><p>Once the potatoes are chopped, we recommend letting them soak in a deep plate. This way we prevent them from turning brown as a result of oxidation, and we also <strong>eliminate part of the starch</strong> that the potatoes have, thus preventing them from sticking to each other when fried.</p></li>
    <li><p>
        Soaking the fries before frying them is optional but it seems appropriate to me, <strong>limiting the soaking to about 15 minutes</strong> , which is enough to eliminate most of the starch and which we use to prepare the pans, oil, etc.
    </p>
</li>
    <h5>Frying in two stages at two temperatures</h5>
    <li><p>
        <strong>To fry the potatoes well, you need two pans</strong> , one for the first part of the process in which we will fry the potato sticks at 140ยบ for about 7 or 8 minutes, and another for the second phase, in which we will brown and crisp the potatoes. frying them at 190ยบ for about five more minutes.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        Some recommend an intermediate phase between the two frying, in which the pre-fried potatoes are put in the <strong> freezer for about 30 minutes</strong> and then finished by frying at high temperature. (It can be done but in my opinion, the difference is not so noticeable, a rest of about 10 minutes between one frying and another is enough to get impressive fries).
    </p></li>
    <li><p>
        <strong>The temperature shock</strong> , when putting the potatoes in the second pan, makes the potatoes, in addition to being crispy, somewhat cracked on the outside, which increases the sensation of crunch. Inside, they are still soft, like candied, thanks to their passage through the first pan
    </p></li>
    <h6>Drained potatoes</h6>
    <li><p>
        French fries retain heat very well. That is why there is no problem in letting them rest on <strong>absorbent kitchen paper to remove any excess oil that they may have retained</strong> . In any case, with this technique, in the final frying at high temperature or " deep fry ", the potatoes absorb less oil than if it is done progressively by increasing the heat.
    </p></li>
